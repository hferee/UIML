abstract="We provide a new sequent calculus that enjoys syntactic cut-elimination and strongly terminating backward proof search for the intuitionistic Strong L{\"o}b logic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}textsf{\{}iSL{\}}{\$}{\$}, an intuitionistic modal logic with a provability interpretation. A novel measure on sequents is used to prove both the termination of the naive backward proof search strategy, and the admissibility of cut in a syntactic and direct way, leading to a straightforward cut-elimination procedure. All proofs have been formalised in the interactive theorem prover Coq.",

@article{FerGoo2023,
  abstract = {A surprising result of Pitts (1992) says that propositional quantifiers are definable internally in intuitionistic propositional logic (IPC). The main contribution of this paper is to provide a formalization of Pitts’ result in the Coq proof assistant, and thus a verified implementation of Pitts’ construction. We in addition provide an OCaml program, extracted from the Coq formalization, which computes propositional formulas that realize intuitionistic versions of ∃p φ and ∀p φ from p and φ.},
